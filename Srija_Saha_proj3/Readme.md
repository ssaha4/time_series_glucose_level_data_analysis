save the pickle files in the same directory.
3. Run test.py
4. enter the input csv file name and place the file in the same directory as test.py and train.py
5. This will output the predicted labels(bins) for dbscan and k means and will save the output in output.csv file.
   The first column will be the bins for dbscan and next one for bins for kmeans.
